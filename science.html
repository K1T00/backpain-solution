                        Out of necessity, I built a training device to effectively train certain back muscles. 
                        The background to why I did that is explained below.</p>
                    <p>
                        The knowledge needed to understand my intentions behind it is a mix of 
                        scientific literature, anatomy and mechanics. 
                        Reading the text gives you also a good understanding of one of the main causes of back pain.
                    </p>           
                    <p>
                        The journey to building the device began for me with back pain in the lumbar region. 
                        I would rate my physical health (mid-30s, 15 years of fitness training, never overweight, 
                        never smoked, little alcohol, insulin sensitive, etc.) as being in the 99th percentile of society. 
                        So why do I have back pain?</p>

            <h2>1.1 Back pain is an epidemic</h2>
                <div class="col">
                    <p>
                        It seems as if everyone knows someone who has back pain. 
                        A quick search in the literature explains the reasons. 
                        Back pain is considered one of the biggest health problems worldwide [1]. 
                        In the USA, it is estimated that the costs caused by lower back pain (LBP) amoun
                        t to at least $50 billion[2] per year. In Switzerland, the costs caused by LBP are 
                        estimated to be at least 1.6%[3] of GDP each year. And the trends point to the situation getting worse.</p>
                    <p>
                        Why can't we get back pain under control?

            <h2>1.2 Cause of back pain</h2>
                <div class="col">
                    <p>
                       Apart from some more obvious causes, such as a previous accident, 
                       the cause of LBP is difficult to determine in most cases. 
                       In general, studies[4] [5] [6] [7] show that there is only a weak or no 
                       correlation between LBP and age/body weight/gender/smoking/etc. 
                       The complexity of determining the cause is particularly evident when 
                       looking at the “classic” herniated disc. It is generally known that a 
                       herniated disc causes tears in the annulus fibrosus, which in turn causes 
                       disc tissue to press on nerves and thus cause pain (Fig. 1). What is strange, 
                       however, is that over 20% of people with a herniated disc do not experience any pain[8]. </p>
                    <p>
                       This all sounds frustrating up to this point. Does science not offer a solution?
